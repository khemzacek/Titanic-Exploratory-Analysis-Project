# Titanic-Exploratory-Analysis-Project

This project explores the relationship between demographics and survival for passengers on the Titanic.

It begins with a data set which shows class, sex, and age of passengers as well as whether or not they survived. Several plots are generated to show the relationship between these variables. A plot which shows survival ratio by all three demographics helps viewers to see whether _they_ would have had a chance of surviving on the Titanic.
